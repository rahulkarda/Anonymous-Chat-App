## Anonymous Chat App
A Realtime Chat App which allows multiple users to join and chat anonymously. Built using Node and Socket.io

This app uses the Web Socket API which allows bi-directional communication between web clients and servers.

The user after choosing a username can connect and chat anonymously with multiple users in real-time.

The site is live at https://anonymous-chat-app.vercel.app/

[Web Socket API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. It is a stateful protocol, which means the connection between client and server will keep alive until it is terminated by either party (client or server). After closing the connection by either of the client and server, the connection is terminated from both ends. 

[Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) is an event-driven JavaScript library for real-time web applications. It enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers.

## Optimizations
While improving this project, I would start by implementing the following features -

   1. Creating multiple chat groups
   2. Handling mobile phone users
   3. Implement more features and provide more options for the user
              
## Lessons Learned
I learned how to integrate an API into a project and how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript to create a chat app project. I learned about the WebSocket API which is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server. I learned how to use Socket.io library which is an event-driven JavaScript library for real-time web applications. It enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers.
